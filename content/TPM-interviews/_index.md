Preparing for TPM interviews involves much more than being qualified and doing
well in your current job. <br>

Depending on your skills and job level, preparing for
TPM interviews may take several weeks of effort. Start with doing a bit of
research on the company and the specific role you have applied for. Explore what
is expected of the role based on the job description and your recruiter call.
Make a list of common questions expected during the interview; reflect on how
you would respond to each question. It is common practice to ask a few
scenario-based questions during the interviews; delve into your experiences to
find examples of different situations you have encountered. Knowing the answers
is not enough; delivering the answers in a manner showcasing strong
communication skills is important. Rehearse delivering your answers. 

I've done hundreds of TPM interviews, and it usually only takes the first few
minutes to get a directional insight into how the rest of the interview would
go. Be prepared for the “Tell Me About You” question, practice the short and long
versions of the response. Be prepared to answer questions on what you said in
the introductions. Also, be prepared to respond to anything related to what is
written in your résumé.
