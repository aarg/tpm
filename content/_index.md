This site discusses the role of a (Technical) Program Manager, explains [what](/what/) they do, and [how](/how/). You will learn more about the role of a Technical Program Manager in a hi-tech, fast-paced software development environment.

<br>I have used the terms Project Manager, Program Manager, and Technical Program Manager (TPM) interchangeably as I believe the majority of the role is still the same. Subtle differences in these roles are explained [here](/what/roles/#pgm-and-tpm). At a high level, program managers:

* Get things done
* Bring order to chaos
* Bring clarity to situations
* Ensure team is always making progress

Program managers wear different hats depending on the situation, the [TPM role](what/tpm_role/) has so much to offer. People typically become a program manager to gain experience in the technical and business domain. The position forms an integral part of a team. I think about this role as a center in the “Hub and spoke” model. Good program managers know the pulse of their projects, become the central source of information, and are accountable for moving projects forward.
