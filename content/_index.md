## Program Managers

I have used the terms Project Manager, Program Manager, and Technical Program Manager (TPM) interchangeably as I believe the majority of the role is still the same. Subtle differences in these roles are explained [here](/what/roles/#pgm-and-tpm). At a high level, program managers:

* Get things done
* Bring order to chaos
* Bring clarity to situations
* Ensure team is always making progress

Program managers wear different hats depending on the situation, the role has so much to offer. People generally get into this role to gain experience in the technical and business side of things. This role is an integral part of any team. I think of this role as the Hub in the Hub and spoke model. Good program managers always know the pulse of their projects, they become the central source of information and are responsible for pacing the projects.
