## Content

## Website
This website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/), the static website generator tool. Hugo is easy to use and it was quite fun to put everything together. The main challenge with Hugo was choosing and customizing the theme. The way Hugo works is that you have to select the theme first and then try to fit in your content in there. After a few tries, I finally settled on [Ace documentation](https://themes.gohugo.io/ace-documentation/) theme. Ace documentation supports [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) which makes it fully responsive out of the box and allows for quick and easy customization e.g [font awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/) is one of my favorite features.

## Editor
All of my projects start with paper and pencil. This helps me organize my thoughts and design a high-level plan and structure. All the content was originally written in [Google docs](https://docs.google.com/). I used [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor for coding and transferring the content from docs to [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) format.  

## Illustrations
Most of the illustrations are created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Illustrations attributions:
