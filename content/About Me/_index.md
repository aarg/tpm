My name is Rohit. This site is about my learnings on being a Technical Program Manager over the past years. I switched my career to TPM back in 2009 and I am still fascinated by the challenges this role brings. It’s a constantly evolving role that requires a lot of perseverance and consistent effort to be successful. The daily challenges of working in an ambiguous environment make it interesting and keep me going on.

Being successful in this role is an acquired skill that takes practice, experimentation, and patience. There’s no straight path, no defined measures of success, establishing yourself as a successful TPM can sometimes be hard. Working with people, being an essential part of the team, shipping products that improve lives, making change happen are all the elements of making it a rewarding experience.

In this website, I have put together my set of practices and experiences that have helped me being successful at my job. There are no rules, but just a set of my learnings. I hope to help others learn from my experiences.

I currently lead a team of TPMs at Google. I have worked on diverse products at Google: Google Assistant, Google Nest/Home, Play Store, and Payments. More details of my projects and career trajectory at my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohit-gandhi-tpm/). I currently live in the Bay area, California.

I enjoy chatting about career challenges related to the area of program management and helping people out. Feel free to drop me an email/LinkedIn message if there’s any way I can help. I can be reached at gandhi.rohit at gmail dot com.
