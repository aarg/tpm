In an organization, conflicts are relatively common. Disputes and disagreements in themselves are not evil; they just mean that there are different opinions and ways to do things. It means people are vested enough in the problem at hand and are passionate about solving it.
However, Conflicts come in the way of making progress to projects. Conflicts are stressful, not only for the people directly involved but for the entire team. They can impact a team’s productivity, and they need to deal with it head-on. TPMs can play a critical role in solving such workplace team conflicts. 

TPMs create a safe environment and facilitate conflict resolution. They drive out the ambiguity and bring the real issues front and center. No backchanneling. Solving such workplace conflicts requires a first-principles approach i.e, start with unarguable facts related to the problem in hand e.g *focus on the user* and agree on what the team is solving for, e.g. *choice of technology* or *work prioritization*. For TPMs, unblocking the project and moving forward is the most critical part.  Effective teams have transparent decision-making and escalation processes. TPMs facilitate creating such processes and help the team drive them. TPMs work on resolving the conflicts transparently and respectfully.

### Steps to resolve conflicts

1. **Describe conflict:** Articulate the disagreement. Clearly stating a problem is the first step to solving it. Succinctly describe the two opposite points of view. Sometimes, issues get resolved by just defining the potential conflict.
2. **Include everyone:** Make sure all opinions are heard and respected.
3. **Understand goals and First principles:** Ensure people at both sides of the conflict have common aligned goals. Have an explicit agreement on what are we solving for? Clearly state the points of agreement and disputes.
4. **Options:** What’s the cost of doing nothing? List down other options with pros/cons. All viable options must satisfy goals and first principles. 
5. **Decision making:** Appoint a responsible decision-maker. Not all decisions are perfect; in fact, the more complex the situation is, the harder it is to gauge an early impact of one decision over another. The role of the decision-maker is to make an informed decision based on what’s known today.
6. **Optionally, involve third-party:** Usually, a subject matter expert or a neutral person who is not attached to a specific outcome but has the team’s trust to make the right decision.
7. **Escalation:** Sometimes, there’s no go-to decision-maker, or it’s beyond a single person to take that responsibility. It’s time to escalate to higher-ups in the organization and ask them to make a decision. TPMs ensure that the escalation process is aligned with everyone involved, transparent, fair, and runs effectively.
8. **Communication:** Once the decision is made, TPMs ensure that it gets communicated to all stakeholders. It’s essential to write down the outcome, leaving no room for ambiguity.

Team consensus or mutual agreement is not the goal of such a process. People don’t have to agree with each other. Once the decision is made, effective teams commit to it wholeheartedly, without any further negotiations and ambiguity. After this point, TPMs execute the decision and move projects forward.
