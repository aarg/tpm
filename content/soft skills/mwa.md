Managing without Authority. That’s the job. 

When I joined Google Play team, I was given the charge to lead a project that
involved getting work done across eight different Engineering teams in Google
with a total team size of 400+ people. The project had a complex graph of task
dependencies and required a good amount of planning to sequence the work and
create a critical path for delivery. The project lasted for about 2 years. 

Such a situation is hardly unique for TPMs. Managing complex projects and
delivering results is the minimum expectation from the role. TPMs don’t have any
managerial influence, career development, or performance management control over
any of the individuals they work with on projects.  
Here are three soft skills toolset for TPMs to manage their projects effectively
without having authority over individuals:

1. **Building relationships:** Good working relationships is the most essential
   part of success for a TPM. The most important people to build great
   relationships with on the team are the PM and TL(M) on the project. I would
   attribute a major part of my success on the Google Play team project to the
   friendships I developed with the lead PM and TL. We worked very closely
   together, so much so that we were able to cover for each other in most of the
   meetings. There still needs to be clarity on roles and responsibilities for
   each role, but having a strong trust in each other makes a day & night
   difference in the execution of the project. Read more about building
   relationships [here](/ss/relations/).

2. **Effectively utilizing standard Project Management tools:** Project
   management tools help with bringing clarity and tracking the status of the
   project. These tools can also be used for effectively influencing teams and
   individuals to get the work done. Here are a few examples:
   1. **Exec presentations** for indirect influence: While working on this
      complex project in Google Play, there were situations where our project
      dependencies were not prioritized high enough by certain teams. As a TPM,
      I would use the exec presentations to highlight the critical path and the
      gaps. Along with the missing pieces, I would also present the options and
      alternative timelines. Not only this helped with raising awareness, but
      also resulted in faster turnaround times to remove blockers. Keep in mind,
      this is about bringing clarity to situations and not about going behind
      people’s backs. The status updates should not be a surprise to anybody on
      the team. Before going ahead with such an exec presentation, make sure you
      have done the internal alignment with all the working teams and they must
      be on the same page, you don’t want to get into an argument in the exec
      meeting.
   2. **Project milestones and deadlines:** Having clear project milestones and a
      list of tasks to achieve those milestones helps the team prioritize the
      work. Prepare the chase lists for each milestone and track progress.
      Publish dashboards with the status of each task.
   3. **Good meeting hygiene and follow-up on AIs via emails/meeting notes:** If the
      tools allow, present the live meeting notes while you are running the
      meeting. It helps establish a common understanding of what’s being
      discussed. At the end of the meeting, clearly state the Action Items from
      the meeting, make sure the actions are well understood by the assignee.
      Ask for an ETA or an ‘ETA for an ETA’. Once the meeting is over, publish
      and share the notes. Follow-up on actions before they are due. Read
      [here](/how/meetings/) about how to design team meetings cadence.

3. **Working with teams outside your core Engineering team:** The complex
   project I mentioned at the beginning of this article had critical path
   dependencies outside of my core team e.g Core infrastructure and Payments
   flows development wasn’t part of the Eng team I was on, yet their work was
   critical for the full product development. Here are a few ideas on how to
   effectively run such projects.
   1. **Cultivate relationships with champions** on other teams: Identify a
      champion in each of your partner teams. A champion would help you push
      along your project and also work closely with you to get things back on
      track if they ever go sideways. Generally, this would be a PM, TPM, TL, or
      somebody who would have a substantial influence on the team.
   2. **Create a common vision and roadmap** e.g joint OKRs: If your team
      follows a quarterly OKR process for prioritizing work across the team then
      it’s also a good tool for cross-team alignment. Work with other teams to
      create a joint OKR with specific objectives related to your project.
   3. **Exec level agreements:** It’s good to have cross-team exec reviews to
      align on project goals, milestones, and deliverables from each team. It’s
      important to do this at the beginning of the project to get the right
      sponsorship. It’s also important to do so when things are progressing
      well, it helps with building confidence.
   4. **R&R framework of dividing work:** On the Google Play project, I landed
      in a situation where one of the TPMs on a partner team felt that I was
      stepping on their toes. We resolved this problem by creating a clearly
      defined Roles and Responsibilities spreadsheet. We both had a written
      agreement of our commitments and held each other accountable for our areas
      of work.
