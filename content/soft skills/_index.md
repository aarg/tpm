The intangibles. <br> <br> Itâ€™s a complex world where success is measured in terms of your achievements in life. Your achievements depend on how you, as a TPM, deliver your projects while working with so many different people. The important part is how you show up as an individual and engage with your peers. How do you manage without any direct authority, communicate up and down, solve problems, build relationships, be seen as credible and trustworthy, and lead the team? <br> <br>
Although these skills are not specific to the [TPM role](/what/tpm_role/), they are core to this central role in any organization. This section of the website talks about how these skills relate to the TPM role and how you can acquire and practice them. In contrast to hard skills, there are no fixed rules to these skills; they are adaptable to your personality type and work style.
