To succeed as a TPM, building meaningful working relationships with close peers
is probably the most important thing you can do. Our relationships form the
foundation of getting work done in collaboration with others. Good relationships
make everything so much easier and joyful, even when your project is challenging. 

Building relationships is hard; it takes time and conscious effort. You need to be consistent and persistent. You need to be genuinely interested in people and their lives. You don’t need to be best friends with everyone, but it helps prioritize your time investment in a few key relationships.

All of the successful projects in my career are attributed to strong
relationships with close peers. And, the opposite is also true. 

Great relationships are based on trust. In a work environment, the best way to
build trust is to keep your commitments and some. Do the work that you promised
and do your best work. Get back to people when they expect you to. Help others
get the work done. Reach out to people when you need help. Do it consistently. 

Investing in regular 1:1 time is another way to create a meaningful connection.
Schedule coffee time. Take walks together if your work location allows that.
Talk about strategy, do working sessions to solve problems, improve processes,
simplify project complexity. Talk about stuff besides work. 

A positive mindset and attitude go a long way. Organize your projects in a way
that encourages people to keep moving forward. An easy-to-read progress report
invites people to talk about your work and also keeps them engaged in the
project. Receive feedback as a gift; keep up the welcoming attitude.

Appreciate people’s effort and work. Everybody is trying to do their best; it
helps to acknowledge the work. Say thank you. 

 Be generous.
