Effective communication is a critical element to the success of any program
manager. **Clear and transparent** communication ensures everyone is on the same
page and moves the projects forward. 

The **cost of poor communication is high**. In the world of information
overload, it’s hard to get yourself heard. Far too many emails result in
information getting lost. People are running from one meeting to another; a
poorly run meeting sucks out people’s energy. Ambiguous communications can lead
to misunderstanding and conflicts. 

On the other hand: clear, concise, and consistent communication can lead to a
highly productive and positive environment. It improves the team’s efficiency. 


Communication is about **making connections**, getting your point across the way you
intended it to be. You don’t have to be formal; just be clear. Communicate with
an intent. Before sending the message or speaking in a meeting, think about
what’s one thing that you’d like to convey.

Chose the **right medium** to communicate. A set of step-by-step instructions
must be written in a document that people can read and follow repeatedly.
Whereas brainstorming is best-done face to face using a whiteboard. Emails are
useful when you are not expecting an immediate response or any response at all.
Chat messages are helpful when looking for short-n-quick answers; long
conversations are much better made over a phone or videoconference. Nothing
beats an in-person meeting. Keep in mind that the communication medium
preference also varies for individuals. 

It goes both ways. If you receive a communication that wasn’t clear or is likely
to confuse the team, ask. **Bringing clarity** to the team is an essential part of
the TPM’s job. 

If you are trying to persuade somebody to go your way, you need to have a clear
understanding of where the other person is coming from and which way you are
taking them. You can’t communicate unless you **listen**. 

TPMs are responsible for a considerable amount of communication within teams and
on projects.

### Program Communication

Always have program status available at a known standard site or wiki page.
People and stakeholders should be aware of where to go to find the latest
information. Having a single source of truth avoids misunderstanding and gets
everyone on the same page. 

Be consistent with status reporting. Design the format and
[color-coding](how/traffic_signals) scheme for your updates. 

Be clear. Be precise. Get to the point, fast. 

If you want to communicate something that takes more than few sentences,
document it. Email is good for one-time asynchronous communication. However,
documents live for a long time, can be referenced again, and updated when new
information is available. 

### Program Meetings

[Here’s](/how/meetings) a section on how to design your meetings.

As a TPM, you would host lots of meetings every day. **Facilitate meetings well**.
Allow everyone to feel welcome and encourage people to participate. Ensure
everyone gets a chance to speak and share their opinions. Respect all ideas and
inputs. 

Take notes and share them afterward with the team. **Be clear on Action items**: who
needs to do what by when. Summarize the discussions. More on this here.

Structure your meetings with a pre-defined **agenda and goals**. It helps to
call-out if we plan to make any decisions or a brainstorming or information
sharing session.
