At the start of a project, there are plenty of unknowns. A TPM plays a crucial role in organizing and setting up the project structure right from the start. It’s essential to set up the execution structure initially as it becomes exponentially difficult to create new processes later on. At the initial phase of the project, a TPM would organize all the available information, get the teams together, provide tools and mechanisms for the teams to share information and progress. This document aims to explain how a TPM standardizes the common practices so that the rest of the team can focus on getting things done.

This standardization is also known as setting up a Governance or an Execution Structure for the team.

## Goals of Execution Structure

* **Project Organization:** A structure for project tracking and status reporting.
* **Centralized information:** A central location (wiki or sites page) for assembling project-related information.
* **Bring clarity:** A well-documented process and execution structure help the team follow the progress and avoid confusion.

## Execution structure

### Prerequisites

You need few basic things in place before you can start putting together an Execution Structure:
* **Team leads:** As you start putting the structure in place, make sure you have the buy-in from leadership, and they have allocated the PM, TL, and TPM (that’s you) to the project. PM and TL will also help you to get other folks needed to execute the project.
* **Core team:** Apart from leads, you will also need people representing the core groups to start scoping out the work required to deliver the complete project.
* **Basic documentation:** Generally, a PM would have put together an initial version of the PRD by this time. Suppose the project requires new UIs or UX changes, then you might also need initial mockups to demonstrate the details of the project.
* **Timelines:** Pay special attention and document any external events or time to market pressures driving the project’s launch. What are the most critical factors influencing the launch timelines? Deadlines would affect many of the design and execution decisions that the team makes.
* **Project Management triangle:** Have a sense of constraints for a project: Resources, Time and Scope. Know where you have some flexibility and where the risks are for the project. This understanding will be crucial to driving critical decisions for the project.

### Elements of execution structure

Creating a centralized wiki or website is highly recommended. As the TPM, you should take the responsibility of maintaining and keeping it up-to-date. Project’s Wiki pages would contain all the relevant information about the project. Below is the list of things you may need to put together an Execution structure and link them to the Project’s wiki page:

#### Project Tracking and reporting

  * **Milestones and timelines document:**
  Well-defined milestones and timelines help manage the project’s progress and risks. Create chase lists for each milestone.
  * **Project Workstreams:**
  Break the project into several workstreams. This helps manage the complexity and creates independent swim-lanes for various leads to manage their work and timelines.
  * **Project Tracker:**
  Overall tracking for the project and also have the structure in place for each workstream and granular task tracking. The project tracker clearly shows the dependencies for various milestones and tasks and also highlights risks at any given time for the project.
  * **Status reporting:**
  Publish a periodic newsletter that includes: Exec summary, Next Milestones, Highlights of what got done since the last update, Risks for next milestone and program overall, and Detailed status of each workstream.

There are plenty of tools available to do all of the above things, but the main thing is to have a consistent place where all of these documents are updated periodically. All stakeholders must be aware of where to go to find the latest information about the project.

#### Documentation structure

  * Create a centralized repository for all project-related documentation.
  * Create sub-folders for each Workstream
  * Create a program management folder for things like timelines, project
    trackers, project decisions, etc.
  * Key documents like timeline, progress report, current risks, and plan of record must be evident

#### Email aliases

Depending on the project, you may need to create various email aliases for information distribution. Too many granular lists can be hard to manage, and too little could lead to information overload. Start with thinking about what kind of information you would like to share regularly. I’d recommend to start with at least three kinds of email aliases and adjust them later as the project progresses:

  * *<project_name>-leads@*
    * Purpose: Leads discussion, escalations, sensitive discussions
    * Members: Typically, this will consist of PM, TPM, TL, TLM, and UX lead
  * *<project_name>-core-team@*
    * Purpose: day-to-day project execution
    * Members: Everyone working on the project
  * *<project_name>-all@*
    * Purpose: Broader announcements, weekly newsletter distribution
    * Members: All stakeholders

#### Meetings

Depending on the project, you may need to create various meetings to run the project smoothly. Here’s an example of the structure of the meetings you might want to create at the start of the project:  

  * Leads weekly sync
  * Core team weekly sync  
  * Partner team(s) sync
  * Per workstream weekly sync

##### For each meeting:
  * List down meeting owner, goals, and attendees
  * Attach the meeting notes link to the calendar invite
  * Share notes with all attendees and stakeholders
