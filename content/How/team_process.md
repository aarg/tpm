As a TPM, sometimes you are expected to run various team-wide processes that are not specific to one project, but rather impacts entire Engineering and Product teams. These processes define the team culture, enforces good practices, and helps the team make progress in a meaningful way. TPMs are generally well situated in the org to drive these processes as it requires collaboration across various functions. n this section, we will review a few of such processes, meetings associated with them, and the role of a TPM.

## Processes
In any product focussed organization, a TPM can set up the following processes to greatly enhance collaboration and productivity of the group. Not only do these processes help with bringing clarity, but also promote discipline and a sense of progress for the product development life-cycle.


### Product reviews
Product review covers a broad set of topics related to the products that the team is working on. As a TPM, you can work with your PM to define what kind of topics should be covered in product reviews, some of the common topics for product reviews are:
  * Product decision making
  * Product roadmap
  * Product development updates
  * Risk mitigation options

TPMs would define a regular cadence of product reviews for their projects e.g it might be useful to provide monthly status updates to execs. Similarly, TPMs would also be aware if things are not going in the right direction and then prepare to bring up an escalation meeting as part of the product review forum. Another common example is where PMs or TPMs setting up a process to bring Product Requirements Review (sometime also known as PRD reviews) to this forum at the beginning of each project.

### Engineering reviews
Technical design reviews and decision making are the two most common topics for such a meeting. As a TPM, you can work with your Tech lead or Engineering Manager to define what all topics must go through this review. It’s a good practice for Eng to document the technical design of each of the projects and take it through such a review. This process helps with fostering a collaborative culture with Eng teams and also establishes a source of truth for what’s being built and helps various cross-functional teams review such designs.

### Business reviews
The business review would cover product metrics for launched products, market analysis, or business requirements. The metrics and business discussions are not necessarily just related to DAU/MAU, # of users, or financials but many times also related to product features and impact to the market. As a TPM, you can work with PMs, Business Analysts to set up a regular cadence for such a review. TPMs also keep an eye on the important metrics for their projects, help create, publish and, monitor relevant dashboards.


### Product Launch reviews
Any code that ships to production should have a formal review process associated with it. As part of the launch review, the team would go through all the changes to user experience, testing results, beta user feedback, Eng metrics (crash reports, latency, qps, etc…). There should be a designated decision-maker in the room to review all the results and approve (or not) the launch. As a TPM, you would work with PM and Eng leads to set up standard templates for launch reviews and also help with queuing up these meetings.


### Postmortem reviews
*“Learn from the mistakes of others. You can’t live long enough to make them all yourself.” - Eleanor Roosevelt*
When things go wrong, and they always do, have processes in place to learn and recover from them. In this review, the team would cover things like:
* What went wrong
* Steps that led to the failure
* What was the impact
* How to prevent in future
* A detailed list of changes to improve the system failures

As a TPM, you would set up the standard template to drive this process. Keep an eye on which failures need to go through a postmortem review and queue it up. Maintain an archive of all previous postmortems at an easily accessible place.

### Tech talks
Tech talks is an informal knowledge-sharing forum for Engineers. Engineers can sign-up to discuss their recent projects and explain what they did. They can talk about any interesting recent challenge, something new they discovered, or just go into details of a piece of technology they used. It doesn’t necessarily have to be about projects or technologies currently in use by the team. As a TPM, you can work with Engineers and encourage such team-wide information sharing opportunities.

### All Hands
As the name suggests, this is a meeting for all team members. Typically, this meeting would happen once a quarter and would cover main updates for teams or projects, celebrate recent wins, welcome new team members, reflect upon all the things going on in your org. It’s generally driven by a few of the senior leads in the team. TPMs would generally contribute towards building the content for this meeting or sometimes even present the project updates to the team.

## Role of a TPM
The TPM team is responsible for running these core processes for an organization. As a TPM, you would define these processes and also set up the meetings to drive them. You might want to set up a sign-up spreadsheet for these meetings to allow for the team to queue up items for a future dates. These standard set of practices also help the TPMs gain visibility into team dynamics, provides a good pulse of team progress and helps encourage a collaborative culture.
