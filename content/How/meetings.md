In a typical Software organization, a TPM collaborates with a team(s) of software engineers, product managers, tech leads, engineering managers, and various other folks from different functional groups. All these cross-functional groups work together to deliver a common objective.

Meetings are one of the most efficient tools for TPM to bring people together and make progress. However, people dread meetings; sometimes, they take time away from productive work time.

Effective meetings need to be planned and designed. While executing on projects, TPMs are expected to run meetings effectively. [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/teamwork/how-to-run-effective-meetings#:~:text=An%20effective%20meeting%20brings%20a,understanding%20of%20the%20work%20ahead.)
has an excellent definition of an effective meeting:

*An effective meeting brings a thoughtfully selected group of people together
for a specific purpose, provides a forum for open discussion, and delivers a
tangible result: a decision, a plan, a list of great ideas to pursue, a shared
understanding of the work ahead.*{{< /panel >}}

## Designing meetings cadence

A well-structured meeting cadence can help the teams tremendously. For a project
in an execution phase, I'd recommend setting up four different kinds of
meetings:
1. **Leads sync:** This is a meeting for project leads PM, TL, and TPM. The main agenda is to discuss day-to-day activities and progress on the project. This is where you would also discuss risks, mitigation, upcoming milestones, exec presentations, prepare for weekly updates, etc. The frequency of this meeting generally depends on the phase of the project. This meeting could evolve to a daily-standup as the project gets closer to launch. During crunch time, you would also add some of the key players to this daily standup.
2. **Core team weekly sync:** This is the meeting to share information with a broader audience. Generally, you’d invite everyone on the project, including partner teams, to this meeting. As a TPM, you’d prepare the agenda consisting of progress updates, upcoming milestones, any recent changes to the plan of record, any new decisions taken related to the project, pass-downs, or feedback from execs, current risks, and potential mitigation. Be sure to [color code](/how/project_status_colors) the progress updates appropriately. You’d also invite workstreams/area leads to sharing any updates. Open up a general Q & A for the teams. Generally, once a week cadence is good; it may also depend on the number of attendees and the project’s phase.
3. **Partner team(s) sync:** For the teams you work closely with, it’s a good practice to have regular sync. The main agenda for this meeting is to align on things: priorities, deliverables and timelines, product and technical designs, risk mitigation. Many times these meetings become cross-functional working sessions.
4. **Per workstream weekly sync:** Each of the project’s workstreams/areas
   should run their weekly syncs. As a TPM, your participation in those meetings
   would depend on your bandwidth and how closely you work on those areas. At
   the minimum, make sure regular syncs are happening, and meeting notes are shared with the team.


## TPMs role in driving effective Meetings

TPMs drive meetings. Not all of them, but for any project, they would own the majority of the meetings. TPMs would:

* Set and share meeting agendas before the meeting
* Drive the meeting
* Take notes
* Share notes
* Follow-up on actions

### A note about taking notes

Meeting notes are often overlooked, but it’s one of the most efficient tools for TPMs. Regular, good notes are the source of truth on how the project is progressing. It would highlight what got done recently, what’s at risk, and what’s blocked.

Meeting notes describes and clarifies what decisions were made. With so many people in the room, many times, people hear things differently. Far too many times, we have heard: *"I thought we decided ..."*. Meeting notes establishes a common understanding. If the notes don’t happen to be accurate, that’s also fine because then it initiates the discussion and hopefully gets people to an agreement.

Good meeting notes would have the following sections:
* Date of meeting
* Attendees
* Summary of meeting
* List of Action Items. Each action item must specify what needs to be done, by whom, and by when.
* Detailed discussion notes

Meeting notes is an excellent way to assign action items to people and follow-up on them. Depending on the discussions, as a TPM, you may create a ticket to follow-up on action items or add a note to a decision log.

Meeting notes are also a good source of material for your weekly updates to the
team and execs.
