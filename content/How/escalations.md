Escalations are not a bad thing. It’s a way to signal higher-ups that things are going side-ways and the team needs help to get them back on track. There can be two kinds of escalations:

1.  **The world is on fire:** This is where the team must drop everything else and work on the immediate fire until it’s under control. Production outages with a direct impact on revenue or customers are common examples of such escalation. Responding to such a situation requires upfront planning. [Stripe’s Increment article](https://increment.com/on-call/when-the-pager-goes-off/) has a good explanation of how to prepare and respond to such situations.
An important part of preparation is to set the expectations with the teams on the priorities and process for handling such escalations. In this context, escalation means following an already agreed upon standard operating procedure. Leads and execs are expected to help the team by getting the right resources, allowing the them to focus on the immediate crisis, and clear the way.  
  TPM’s can play a central role by organizing the teams for structured response and taking over the role of an Incident commandar (guide the team towards quick resolution) or a Communication lead (help manage incident communication to stakeholders). Altassian has a good explanation of Incident Management roles and responsibilities [here](https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/incident-response/roles-responsibilities)

2.  **Program not going well:** This is where the program is running behind or the team doesn’t have the right resourcing or skills to accomplish its goals. TPMs are usually the first to realize when things are not going well and have the data via program trackers to show where the team needs help. TPMs play a crucial role in managing the escalation. One way to manage escalations is to use the following 3-step approach:
    1.  Gather and present the facts. As an example, if the program is behind schedule, put the data together to show all the milestones, timeline trajectory and deltas. Clearly show the new expected timelines.
    2.  Present the options. Demonstrate the impact of this delay. The first option to resolve the situation might be to do-nothing and accept the delay. If that’s not an acceptable option then use the *[triple constraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle)* framework to present other options i.e Put more (or right) resources on the project or reduce the scope. Again, show the pros/cons and impact of each option.
    3.  Present a recommendation. Have an opinion on what’s the right way to move forward.

    Once the decision is made, make sure to follow-up with proper    communications to the team. If you maintain a plan of record document, then update the document with the decision.
