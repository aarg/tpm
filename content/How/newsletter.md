A newsletter is a great way to share regular project updates with the team. It
is used to communicate the latest information about the status of the project;
helps all stakeholders to get on the same page about progress, risks,
milestones, and timelines. Generally, you’d design the newsletters for the key
stakeholders who are not familiar with the day-to-day activities on the project
but are interested in knowing the progress. For the software projects, I’d
recommend having a weekly or bi-weekly newsletter. It should consist of at least
3 sections:

1. **Highlights:** What got done last week. 
2. **Risks/Needs attention:** Things that are at risk or are delayed. Along with
   the risks, always include potential mitigations, owners, and estimated
   timeline. If any of these things are not known, call that out explicitly. 
3. **Detailed status** of ongoing sub-projects. Call out upcoming milestones.

As a TPM, you are expected to own the Newsletter. For large projects, you might
not know all details; create a process to gather the updates from all sub-teams
on a regular basis. Spreadsheets can work well to gather such information. Be
sure to send the updates out on time, every time. Be consistent with the format.
Make it easier for people to glance through each section quickly. 

## Newsletter template

Below is a newsletter example for the Weather App project that we scoped in this
