Using Red, Yellow, and Green traffic light colors is a good visual way to
represent how the project is tracking against milestones. Itâ€™s a quick status
reporting mechanism that helps the team to know where to focus on. During exec
reviews, it makes it easy to quickly talk through Green wins and focus most of
the discussion on Reds and Yellows. 

Itâ€™s important to have a clear definition of what Red, Yellow, and Green means.
For a project in the execution phase, hereâ€™s a suggestion on how to use traffic
lights indication for status reporting: 


| Color  | Description                                                                             |
| :---:  | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
