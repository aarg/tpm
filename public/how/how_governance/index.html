<h1>How to start a new project</h1>

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="/project_start.png" class="img-fluid " alt="Roles">
</div>
<p>At the start of a project, there are plenty of unknowns. A TPM plays a crucial role to organize and set up the project structure right from the start. It’s very important to set up the execution structure right at the beginning as it becomes exponentially difficult to create new processes later on. At the initial phase of the project, a TPM would organize all the available information, get the teams together, provide tools and mechanisms for the teams to share information, and make progress. The goal of this document is to explain how does a TPM standardizes the common practices so that the rest of the team can focus on getting things done.</p>
<p>This standardization is also known as setting up a Governance or an Execution Structure for the team.</p>
<h2 id="goals-of-execution-structure">Goals of Execution Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Organization:</strong> A structure in place for project tracking and
status reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized information:</strong> A central location (wiki or sites page)
for assembling  all the information.</li>
<li><strong>Bring clarity:</strong> A well-documented process and execution structure in place
helps the team to follow along on progress and avoids confusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="execution-structure">Execution structure</h2>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>You need few basic things in place, before you can start putting together an Execution Structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team leads:</strong> As you start putting the structure in place, make sure you have the buy-in from these leadership and they have allocated the PM, TL and TPM (that’s you) to the project. PM and TL will also help you to get other folks needed to execute on the project.</li>
<li><strong>Core team:</strong> Apart from leads, you will also need people representing the core groups to start scoping out the work required to deliver the complete project.</li>
<li><strong>Basic documentation:</strong> Generally, a PM would have put together an initial version of the PRD by this time. If the project requires new UIs or UX changes. then you might also need initial mockups to demonstrate the details of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Timelines:</strong> Pay special attention and document if there are any external events or time to market pressures driving the launch of this project. What are the most important factors influencing the launch timelines? Deadlines would influence many of the design and execution decisions that the team makes.</li>
<li><strong>Project Management triangle:</strong> Have a sense of constraints for a project: Resources, Time and Scope. Know where you have some flexibility and where are the risks for the project. This understanding will be crucial to driving key decisions for the project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elements-of-execution-structure">Elements of execution structure</h3>
<p>Creating a centralized wiki or sites page is highly recommended. As the TPM, you should take the responsibility of maintaining and keeping it up-to-date. Project’s Wiki pages would contain all the relevant information about the project. Below is the list of things you may need to put together an Execution structure and link them to the Project’s wiki page:</p>
<h4 id="project-tracking-and-reporting">Project Tracking and reporting</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Milestones and timelines document:</strong>
Well defined milestones and timelines help manage the progress and risks for the project. Create chase lists for each milestone.</li>
<li><strong>Project Workstreams:</strong>
Break the project into several workstreams. This helps with managing the
complexity and also creates independent swim-lanes for various leads to
manage their work and timelines</li>
<li><strong>Project Tracker:</strong>
Overall tracking for the project and also have the structure in place for each workstream and granular task tracking. The project tracker clearly shows the dependencies for various milestones and tasks and also highlights risks at any given time for the project.</li>
<li><strong>Status reporting:</strong>
Publish a periodic newsletter that includes: Exec summary, Next Milestones, Highlights of what got done since the last update, Risks for next milestone and program overall, and Detailed status of each workstream.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of tools available to do all of the above things, but the main thing is to have a consistent place where all of these documents are updated periodically. All stakeholders must be aware of where to go to find the latest information about the project.</p>
<h4 id="documentation-structure">Documentation structure</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a centralized repository for all project-related documentation.</li>
<li>Create sub-folders for each Workstream</li>
<li>Create a program management folder for things like timelines, project
trackers, project decisions, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>Key documents like timeline, progress report, current risks and plan of     record must be highly visible</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="email-aliases">Email aliases</h4>
<p>Depending on the project , you may need to create various email aliases for information distribution. Too many granular lists can be hard to manage and too little could lead to information overload. Start with thinking about what kind of information would you like to share on regular basis. I’d recommend to start with at least 3 kinds of email aliases and adjust it later as the project progresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&lt;project_name&gt;-leads@</em>
<ul>
<li>Purpose: Leads discussion, escalations, sensitive discussions &hellip;</li>
<li>Members: Typically, this will consist of PM, TPM, TL, TLM, and UX lead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&lt;project_name&gt;-core-team@</em>
<ul>
<li>Purpose: day-to-day project execution</li>
<li>Members: Everyone working on the project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&lt;project_name&gt;-all@</em>
<ul>
<li>Purpose: Broader announcements, weekly newsletter distribution</li>
<li>Members: All stakeholders</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="meetings">Meetings</h4>
<p>Depending on the project, you may need to create various meetings to smoothly
run the project. Here’s an example of the structure of the meetings you might want to create at the start of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leads weekly sync</li>
<li>Core team weekly sync</li>
<li>Partner team(s) sync</li>
<li>Per workstream weekly sync</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="for-each-meeting">For each meeting:</h5>
<ul>
<li>List down meeting owner, goals, and attendees</li>
<li>Attach the meeting notes link to the calendar invite</li>
<li>Make sure notes are shared out via email</li>
</ul>
