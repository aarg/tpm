            <em>A program manager is an uber-mutated combination of both that usually shows up to handle multiple interrelated projects like, say, an operating system. Different companies use the names differently, but for this article, project = ship the product, product = ship the right product, and program = ship many interrelated products, usually at the same time</em>

<h2 id="pm-product-manager">PM: Product Manager</h2>
<p>Product Manager is responsible for defining what needs to happen and why.
For any Software development project, a PM would work with the team to figure
out what&rsquo;s the right product to develop. PM considers various factors to get
to the definition of the product:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer value:</strong> Does the product add value to its users? What&rsquo;s the change
this product brings in customer&rsquo;s usage of the product? Does it make user&rsquo;s
life easier / better / delightful?</li>
<li><strong>Marketing fit:</strong> Is there a real need for such a product?</li>
<li><strong>Time to market:</strong> Are there any external factors controlling the launch
timeline? Any competing products, do we want to gain first-to-market
advantage?</li>
<li><strong>Time to develop:</strong> How long does it take to develop the product?</li>
<li><strong>MVP:</strong> What&rsquo;s the minimum viable product that can be shipped and serves
it&rsquo;s purpose?</li>
<li><strong>Defining success:</strong> What&rsquo;s the purpose of the product? What metrics would
we measure the success against? Define success based on the product maturity
e.g customer segment and market penetration for new products or revenue for
matured products.</li>
<li><strong>Product features:</strong> Break down the product into a well-defined set of
features. Describe the product usage workflow from user&rsquo;s perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Product definition is generally written in the form of a &lsquo;Product Requirements
Doc&rsquo; (PRD). This definition is expected to evolve during product development
lifecycle as new information comes in.</p>
<p>A PM works with lot of different cross-functional groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PM would work very closely with Program Manager during execution phases of
the project to align on priorities.</li>
<li>A PM would work very closely with Tech Lead to ensure Engineering is building
the product as the PM defined.</li>
<li>A PM would work very closely with UX to get the right designs.</li>
<li>A PM would work very closely with marketing to align on all external factors
influencing product design and launch.</li>
<li>A PM would also work closely with other cross-functional groups such as
Legal, Privacy and Security ensure product is doing the right thing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pgm-and-tpm">PgM and TPM</h2>
<p><strong>PgM: Program Manager</strong>
<strong>TPM: Technical Program Manager</strong></p>
<p>For the most part of this site, I have used PgM and TPM interchangeably.
The main responsibilities for both of these roles are still the same. However,
TPMs are more involved on the technical aspects of their projects. In this
context, technical implies software development. Apart from core Program
Management, here are few examples of what a TPM on  a project could be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the PRD a TPM could write the technical specifications for a project.
This would help Engineers understand the technical aspects for the
requirements.</li>
<li>A TPM generally understands the software architecture and influences technical
choices. This influence generally comes from past experiences or the ability
to understand various technical paths.</li>
<li>A TPM is expected to demonstrate technical judgement during various phases of
the project e.g help with code path optimizations, user latency optimizations
etc&hellip;</li>
<li>A TPM could also contribute to software development / code. Generally, this
might not be a good idea as it takes time away from core job responsibilities
and it us unlikely that a person is good at coding and managing the project
at the same time.</li>
<li>Few more specific activities that a TPM could be doing as technical
contribution to the projects:
<ul>
<li>QA/ Test automation + API validation</li>
<li>Release management</li>
<li>Platform / Infra management e.g managing AWS/Cloud resources. Managing App
store releases via App Developer Console.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tl-tech-lead">TL: Tech Lead</h2>
<p>Tech lead&rsquo;s main responsibility is to drive all Technical aspects of the
project. This is usually seen in the form of architecture or design docs,
figuring out an optimal path to deliver code including technical dependencies,
unblocking Software Engineers on technical decisions etc&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="tlm-tech-lead-manager">TLM: Tech Lead Manager</h2>
<p>TLM usually has few Software Engineers reporting into them and have the
authority to allocate people to projects. They are responsible for career growth
and productivity of individuals. They have a good sense of mapping people to project.</p>
<h2 id="tpm-relationships">TPM Relationships</h2>
<p>Most of the successful projects I have been on have a very strong trio
relationship: PM, TPM and TL. All three roles work very closely with each other.
Although they have very distinct roles, but many a times they are able to
represent each other in various meetings.  This kind of strong bonding and trust
relationship takes time and requires deliberate, conscious effort to develop.
As a TPM, nurturing such a relationship with your PM and TL is part of the job.</p>
